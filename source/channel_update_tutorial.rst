Adding an Org to a Channel -- 向通道添加组织
=================================================================================

.. note:: Ensure that you have downloaded the appropriate images and binaries
          as outlined in :doc:`samples` and :doc:`prereqs` that conform to the
          version of this documentation (which can be found at the bottom of the
          table of contents to the left). In particular, your version of the
          ``fabric-samples`` folder must include the ``eyfn.sh`` ("Extending Your
          First Network") script and its related scripts.

          确保你已经下载了 :doc:`samples` 和 :doc:`prereqs` 中所罗列的和本文档版本（在左边内
          容列表的底部可以查看）一致的镜像和二进制。特别注意，在你的版本中，``fabric-samples``
          文件夹必须包含 ``eyfn.sh`` ("Extending Your First Network")脚本和它相关的脚本。

This tutorial serves as an extension to the :doc:`build_network` (BYFN) tutorial,
and will demonstrate the addition of a new organization -- ``Org3`` -- to the
application channel (``mychannel``) autogenerated by BYFN. It assumes a strong
understanding of BYFN, including the usage and functionality of the aforementioned
utilities.

本指南是 :doc:`build_network` (BYFN) 指南的扩展，将演示一个由
BYFN自动生成的新的组织-- ``Org3`` -- 加入到应用通道 ``mychannel`` 的过程。本篇指南假设你对
BYFN有很好地理解，包括用法以及上面提及的实用工具的功能。

While we will focus solely on the integration of a new organization here, the same
approach can be adopted when performing other channel configuration updates (updating
modification policies or altering batch size, for example). To learn more about the
process and possibilities of channel config updates in general, check out
:doc:`config_update`). It's also worth noting that channel configuration updates like
the one demonstrated here will usually be the responsibility of an organization admin
(rather than a chaincode or application developer).

虽然我们这里将只关注新组织的集成，但执行其他通道配置更新（如更新修改策略，调整批处理
大小）也可以采取相同的方式。查看 :doc:`config_update` 来了解更多的处理细节、
通道配置更新的其他可能通用场景。还有一点值得注意，像本文演示的这些通道配置更新通常是
组织管理者（而非链码或者应用开发者）的职责。

.. note:: Make sure the automated ``byfn.sh`` script runs without error on
          your machine before continuing. If you have exported your binaries and
          the related tools (``cryptogen``, ``configtxgen``, etc) into your PATH
          variable, you'll be able to modify the commands accordingly without
          passing the fully qualified path.

          在继续本文前先确保自动化脚本 ``byfn.sh`` 运行无误。如果你已经把你的二进制和相关的
          工具(如 ``cryptogen``，``configtxgen``）放在了PATH变量指定的路径下，你可以相应地修改命令
          而不使用全量路径。

Setup the Environment -- 环境构建
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be operating from the root of the ``first-network`` subdirectory within
your local clone of ``fabric-samples``. Change into that directory now. You will
also want to open a few extra terminals for ease of use.

我们后续的操作都在 ``fabric-samples`` 项目本地副本的 ``first-network`` 子目录下进行。现在切换
到该目录下。你同时需要打个几个额外的终端，以便于于操作。

First, use the ``byfn.sh`` script to tidy up. This command will kill any active
or stale docker containers and remove previously generated artifacts. It is by no
means **necessary** to bring down a Fabric network in order to perform channel
configuration update tasks. However, for the sake of this tutorial, we want to operate
from a known initial state. Therefore let's run the following command to clean up any
previous environments:

首先，使用 ``byfn.sh`` 脚本清理环境。这个命令会清除运行、终止状态的容器，并且移除之前构建
的部件等。移除Fabric网络并非执行通道配置升级的必要步骤。但是为了便于这个指南的书写，
我们希望从一个已知的初始状态开始，因此让我们运行以下命令来清理之前的环境：

.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh -m down

Now generate the default BYFN artifacts:

现在生成默认的BYFN部件：

.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh -m generate

And launch the network making use of the scripted execution within the CLI container:

然后通过执行CLI容器内的脚本来构建网络：

.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh -m up

Now that you have a clean version of BYFN running on your machine, you have two
different paths you can pursue. First, we offer a fully commented script that will
carry out a config transaction update to bring Org3 into the network.

现在你的机器上运行着一个干净的BYFN版本，你有两种不同的方式可选。第一种，我们提供了一
个通过实施配置交易更新来将Org3添加到网络中的全量注释的脚本。

Also, we will show a "manual" version of the same process, showing each step
and explaining what it accomplishes (since we show you how to bring down your
network before this manual process, you could also run the script and then look at
each step).

我们也提供同样过程的手动版本，演示并说明每一个步骤的作用（因为我们刚演示了在继续手动
操作前如何移除你的网络，你可以先运行那个脚本，然后再来看每个步骤）。

Bring Org3 into the Channel with the Script - 使用脚本向通道加入Org3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should be in ``first-network``. To use the script, simply issue the following:

在 ``first-network`` 目录下，简单地执行以下命令来使用脚本：

.. code:: bash

  ./eyfn.sh up

The output here is well worth reading. You'll see the Org3 crypto material being
added, the config update being created and signed, and then chaincode being installed
to allow Org3 to execute ledger queries.

此处的脚本输出值得一读。你可以看到添加了Org3的加密材料，配置更新被创建、签名，之后链
码被安装，Org3也被允许执行账本查询。

If everything goes well, you'll get this message:

如果诸事顺利，你会看到以下信息：

.. code:: bash

  ========= All GOOD, EYFN test execution completed ===========

``eyfn.sh`` can be used with the same Node.js chaincode and database options
as ``byfn.sh`` by issuing the following (instead of ``./byfn.sh -m -up``):


``eyfn.sh`` 可以使用和 ``byfn.sh`` 一样的Node.js链码和数据库选项，如下所示（替代 ``./byfn.sh -m
-up``）：


.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh up -c testchannel -s couchdb -l node

And then:

然后：

.. code:: bash

  ./eyfn.sh up -c testchannel -s couchdb -l node

For those who want to take a closer look at this process, the rest of the doc will
show you each command for making a channel update and what it does.

对于想要详细了解该过程的人，文档的剩余部分会为你展示通道升级的每个命令，以及命令的作
用。

Bring Org3 into the Channel Manually -- 向通道手动添加Org3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The manual steps outlined below assume that the ``CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL``
          in the ``cli`` and `Org3cli`` containers is set to ``DEBUG``.

          下面的步骤均假设 ``CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL`` 变量在 ``cli`` 和 ``Org3cli`` 容器中设置为 ``DEBUG``。

          For the ``cli`` container, you can set this by modifying the
          ``docker-compose-cli.yaml`` file in the ``first-network`` directory.
          e.g.

          你可以通过修改 ``first-network`` 目录下的 ``docker-compose-cli.yaml`` 文件来配置 ``cli`` 容器。
          例：

          .. code::

            cli:
              container_name: cli
              image: hyperledger/fabric-tools:$IMAGE_TAG
              tty: true
              stdin_open: true
              environment:
                - GOPATH=/opt/gopath
                - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
                #- CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
                - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG

          For the ``Org3cli`` container, you can set this by modifying the
          ``docker-compose-org3.yaml`` file in the ``first-network`` directory.
          e.g.

          你可以通过修改 ``first-network`` 目录下的 ``docker-compose-org3.yaml`` 文件来配置 ``Org3cli`` 容
          器。例：

          .. code::

            Org3cli:
              container_name: Org3cli
              image: hyperledger/fabric-tools:$IMAGE_TAG
              tty: true
              stdin_open: true
              environment:
                - GOPATH=/opt/gopath
                - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
                #- CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
                - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG

If you've used the ``eyfn.sh`` script, you'll need to bring your network down.
This can be done by issuing:

如果你已经使用了 ``eyfn.sh`` 脚本，你需要先移除你的网络。通过如下所示命令来完成：

.. code:: bash

  ./eyfn.sh down

This will bring down the network, delete all the containers and undo what we've
done to add Org3.

When the network is down, bring it back up again.

这会移除网络，删除所有的容器，并且撤销我们添加Org3的操作。

当网络移除后，再次将它建立起来。

.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh -m generate

Then:

然后：

.. code:: bash

  ./byfn.sh -m up

This will bring your network back to the same state it was in before you executed
the ``eyfn.sh`` script.

这会将你的网络恢复到你执行 ``eyfn.sh`` 脚本之前的状态。

Now we're ready to add Org3 manually. As a first step, we'll need to generate Org3's
crypto material.

现在我们可以手动添加Org3。第一步，我们需要生成Org3的加密材料。

Generate the Org3 Crypto Material -- 生成Org3加密材料
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In another terminal, change into the ``org3-artifacts`` subdirectory from
``first-network``.

在另一个终端，切换到 ``first-network`` 的子目录 ``org3-artifacts`` 中。

.. code:: bash

  cd org3-artifacts

There are two ``yaml`` files of interest here: ``org3-crypto.yaml`` and ``configtx.yaml``.
First, generate the crypto material for Org3:

这里需要关注两个 ``yaml`` 文件：``org3-crypto.yaml`` 和 ``configtx.yaml``。首先，生成Org3的加密
材料：

.. code:: bash

  ../../bin/cryptogen generate --config=./org3-crypto.yaml

This command reads in our new crypto ``yaml`` file -- ``org3-crypto.yaml`` -- and
leverages ``cryptogen`` to generate the keys and certificates for an Org3
CA as well as two peers bound to this new Org. As with the BYFN implementation,
this crypto material is put into a newly generated ``crypto-config`` folder
within the present working directory (in our case, ``org3-artifacts``).

该命令读取我们新的加密 ``yaml`` 文件 -- ``org3-crypto.yaml`` -- 然后调用 ``cryptogen`` 来为Org3 CA
和其他两个绑定到这个组织的peers生成秘钥和证书。如同BYFN实现，加密材料放到最近生成的 ``crypto-config``
文件夹下，均在当前工作路径下（在我们例子中是 ``org3-artifacts``）。

Now use the ``configtxgen`` utility to print out the Org3-specific configuration
material in JSON. We will preface the command by telling the tool to look in the
current directory for the ``configtx.yaml`` file that it needs to ingest.

现在使用 ``configtxgen`` 工具打印出Org3对应的配置材料，用JSON格式展示。我们将在执行命令
前，告诉这个工具去获取当前目录的 ``configtx.yaml`` 文件。

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD && ../../bin/configtxgen -printOrg Org3MSP > ../channel-artifacts/org3.json

The above command creates a JSON file -- ``org3.json`` -- and outputs it into the
``channel-artifacts`` subdirectory at the root of ``first-network``. This
file contains the policy definitions for Org3, as well as three important certificates
presented in base 64 format: the admin user certificate (which will be needed to act as
the admin of Org3 later on), a CA root cert, and a TLS root cert. In an upcoming step we
will append this JSON file to the channel configuration.

上面的命令会创建一个JSON文件 -- ``org3.json`` -- 并把文件输出到 ``first-network`` 的 ``channel-artifacts``
子目录下。这个文件包含了Org3的策略定义，还有base 64编码的重要的证
书：管理员用户证书（之后作为Org3的管理员角色），一个根证书，一个TLS根证书。之后的步
骤我们会用这个JSON文件去扩展通道配置。

Our final piece of housekeeping is to port the Orderer Org's MSP material into
the Org3 ``crypto-config`` directory. In particular, we are concerned with the
Orderer's TLS root cert, which will allow for secure communication between
Org3 entities and the network's ordering node.

我们最后的例行工作是拷贝排序Org的MSP材料到Org3的 ``crypto-config`` 目录下。我们尤其关注
排序服务的TLS根证书，它可以用于Org3的通信实体和网络的排序节点间的安全通信。

.. code:: bash

  cd ../ && cp -r crypto-config/ordererOrganizations org3-artifacts/crypto-config/

Now we're ready to update the channel configuration...

现在我们准备开始升级通道配置。

Prepare the CLI Environment 准备CLI环境
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The update process makes use of the configuration translator tool -- ``configtxlator``.
This tool provides a stateless REST API independent of the SDK. Additionally it
provides a CLI, to simplify configuration tasks in Fabric networks. The tool allows
for the easy conversion between different equivalent data representations/formats
(in this case, between protobufs and JSON). Additionally, the tool can compute a
configuration update transaction based on the differences between two channel
configurations.

更新的步骤需要用到配置转化工具 -- ``configtxlator``，这个工具提供了和SDK无关的无状态REST API。
它还额外提供了CLI，用于简化Fabric网络中的配置任务。这个工具提供不同的数据表示/格
式间进行转化的便利功能（在这个例子中就是protobufs和JSON格式的互转）。另外，这个工具
能基于两个不同的通道配置计算出配置更新交易。

First, exec into the CLI container. Recall that this container has been
mounted with the BYFN ``crypto-config`` library, giving us access to the MSP material
for the two original peer organizations and the Orderer Org. The bootstrapped
identity is the Org1 admin user, meaning that any steps where we want to act as
Org2 will require the export of MSP-specific environment variables.

首先，进入到CLI容器。这个容器挂载了BYFN ``crypto-config`` 库，允许我们访问两个原始的peer节点组织和
Orderer排序组织。默认的身份是Org1的管理员用户，所以如果我们想作为Org2进行任何操作，需要设置和MSP相关的环境变量。

.. code:: bash

  docker exec -it cli bash

Now install the ``jq`` tool into the container. This tool allows script interactions
with JSON files returned by the ``configtxlator`` tool:

现在在容器里安装 ``jq`` 工具。这个工具可以解析 ``configtxlator`` 工具返回的JSON文件。

.. code:: bash

  apt update && apt install -y jq

Export the ``ORDERER_CA`` and ``CHANNEL_NAME`` variables:

Export ``ORDERER_CA`` 和 ``CHANNEL_NAME`` 变量。

.. code:: bash

  export ORDERER_CA=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem  && export CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel

Check to make sure the variables have been properly set:

检查并确保环境变量已合理设置：

.. code:: bash

  echo $ORDERER_CA && echo $CHANNEL_NAME

.. note:: If for any reason you need to restart the CLI container, you will also need to
          re-export the two environment variables -- ``ORDERER_CA`` and ``CHANNEL_NAME``.
          The jq installation will persist. You need not install it a second time.

          如果因为什么原因需要重启CLI容器，你会需要重新设置 ``ORDERER_CA`` 和 ``CHANNEL_NAME`` 这两个
          环境变量。jq安装会持久化，你不需要再次安装它。

Fetch the Configuration 获取配置
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we have a CLI container with our two key environment variables -- ``ORDERER_CA``
and ``CHANNEL_NAME`` exported.  Let's go fetch the most recent config block for the
channel -- ``mychannel``.

现在我们有了一个设置了 ``ORDERER_CA`` 和 ``CHANNEL_NAME`` 环境变量的CLI容器。让我们获取通道 ``mychannel``
的最近的配置区块。

The reason why we have to pull the latest version of the config is because channel
config elements are versioned.. Versioning is important for several reasons. It prevents
config changes from being repeated or replayed (for instance, reverting to a channel config
with old CRLs would represent a security risk). Also it helps ensure concurrency (if you
want to remove an Org from your channel, for example, after a new Org has been added,
versioning will help prevent you from removing both Orgs, instead of just the Org you want
to remove).

我们必须拉取最新版本配置的原因是通道配置元素是版本化的。版本管理由于一些原因显得很重
要。它可以防止通道配置更新被重复或者重放攻击（例如，回退到带有旧的CRLs的通道配置将会
产生安全风险）。同时它保证了并行性（例如如果你想从你的通道中添加新的Org后移除一个
Org，版本管理可以帮助你移除想移除的那个Org，防止移除两个Orgs）。

.. code:: bash

  peer channel fetch config config_block.pb -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA

This command saves the binary protobuf channel configuration block to
``config_block.pb``. Note that the choice of name and file extension is arbitrary.
However, following a convention which identifies both the type of object being
represented and its encoding (protobuf or JSON) is recommended.

这个命令将通道配置区块以二进制protobuf形式保存在 ``config_block.pb``。注意文件的名字和扩
展名可以任意指定。然而，我们建议之后根据区块存储对象的类型和编码格式（protobuf或
JSON）进行转换。

When you issued the ``peer channel fetch`` command, there was a decent amount of
output in the terminal. The last line in the logs is of interest:

当你执行 ``peer channel fetch`` 命令后，在终端上会有相当数量的打印输出。日志的最后一行比较
有意思：

.. code:: bash

  2017-11-07 17:17:57.383 UTC [channelCmd] readBlock -> DEBU 011 Received block: 2

This is telling us that the most recent configuration block for ``mychannel`` is
actually block 2, **NOT** the genesis block. By default, the ``peer channel fetch config``
command returns the most **recent** configuration block for the targeted channel, which
in this case is the third block. This is because the BYFN script defined anchor
peers for our two organizations -- ``Org1`` and ``Org2`` -- in two separate channel update
transactions.

这是告诉我们最近的 ``mychannel`` 的配置区块实际上是区块2，**非** 初始区块。 ``peer channel fetch config``
命令默认返回目标通道最新的配置区块，在这个例子里是第三个区
块。这是因为BYFN脚本分别在两个不同通道更新交易中为两个组织-- ``Org1`` 和 ``Org2`` 定义了锚节
点。

As a result, we have the following configuration sequence:

那么，我们有如下的配置块序列：

  * block 0: genesis block
  * block 1: Org1 anchor peer update
  * block 2: Org2 anchor peer update

Convert the Configuration to JSON and Trim It Down -- 转换配置到JSON格式并裁剪
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we will make use of the ``configtxlator`` tool to decode this channel
configuration block into JSON format (which can be read and modified by humans).
We also must strip away all of the headers, metadata, creator signatures, and
so on that are irrelevant to the change we want to make. We accomplish this by
means of the ``jq`` tool:

现在我们是用 ``configtxlator`` 的工具将这个通道配置转换为JSON格式（以便友好地被阅读和修
改）。我们也必须裁剪所有的头部，元数据，创建者签名等这些和我们即将做的无关的内容。我
们通过 ``jq`` 这个工具来实现：

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator proto_decode --input config_block.pb --type common.Block | jq .data.data[0].payload.data.config > config.json

This leaves us with a trimmed down JSON object -- ``config.json``, located in
the ``fabric-samples`` folder inside ``first-network`` -- which
will serve as the baseline for our config update.

我们得到一个裁剪后的JSON对象 -- ``config.json`` ，放置在 ``fabric-samples`` 下的 ``first-network``
文件夹下 -- ``first-network`` 是我们配置更新的基准工作目录。

Take a moment to open this file inside your text editor of choice (or in your
browser). Even after you're done with this tutorial, it will be worth studying it
as it reveals the underlying configuration structure and the other kind of channel
updates that can be made. We discuss them in more detail in :doc:`config_update`.

花一些时间用你的text编辑器（或者你的浏览器）打开这个文件。即使你已经完成了这个指南，
也值得研究下它，因为它揭示了底层配置结构，和能做的其它类型的通道更新升级。我们将在
:doc:`config_update` 更详细地讨论。

Add the Org3 Crypto Material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The steps you've taken up to this point will be nearly identical no matter
          what kind of config update you're trying to make. We've chosen to add an
          org with this tutorial because it's one of the most complex channel
          configuration updates you can attempt.

We'll use the ``jq`` tool once more to append the Org3 configuration definition
-- ``org3.json`` -- to the channel's application groups field, and name the output
-- ``modified_config.json``.

.. code:: bash

  jq -s '.[0] * {"channel_group":{"groups":{"Application":{"groups": {"Org3MSP":.[1]}}}}}' config.json ./channel-artifacts/org3.json > modified_config.json

Now, within the CLI container we have two JSON files of interest -- ``config.json``
and ``modified_config.json``. The initial file contains only Org1 and Org2 material,
whereas "modified" file contains all three Orgs. At this point it's simply
a matter of re-encoding these two JSON files and calculating the delta.

First, translate ``config.json`` back into a protobuf called ``config.pb``:

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator proto_encode --input config.json --type common.Config --output config.pb

Next, encode ``modified_config.json`` to ``modified_config.pb``:

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator proto_encode --input modified_config.json --type common.Config --output modified_config.pb

Now use ``configtxlator`` to calculate the delta between these two config
protobufs. This command will output a new protobuf binary named ``org3_update.pb``:

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator compute_update --channel_id $CHANNEL_NAME --original config.pb --updated modified_config.pb --output org3_update.pb

This new proto -- ``org3_update.pb`` -- contains the Org3 definitions and high
level pointers to the Org1 and Org2 material. We are able to forgo the extensive
MSP material and modification policy information for Org1 and Org2 because this
data is already present within the channel's genesis block. As such, we only need
the delta between the two configurations.

Before submitting the channel update, we need to perform a few final steps. First,
let's decode this object into editable JSON format and call it ``org3_update.json``:

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator proto_decode --input org3_update.pb --type common.ConfigUpdate | jq . > org3_update.json

Now, we have a decoded update file -- ``org3_update.json`` -- that we need to wrap
in an envelope message. This step will give us back the header field that we stripped away
earlier. We'll name this file ``org3_update_in_envelope.json``:

.. code:: bash

  echo '{"payload":{"header":{"channel_header":{"channel_id":"mychannel", "type":2}},"data":{"config_update":'$(cat org3_update.json)'}}}' | jq . > org3_update_in_envelope.json

Using our properly formed JSON -- ``org3_update_in_envelope.json`` -- we will
leverage the ``configtxlator`` tool one last time and convert it into the
fully fledged protobuf format that Fabric requires. We'll name our final update
object ``org3_update_in_envelope.pb``:

.. code:: bash

  configtxlator proto_encode --input org3_update_in_envelope.json --type common.Envelope --output org3_update_in_envelope.pb

Sign and Submit the Config Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost done!

We now have a protobuf binary -- ``org3_update_in_envelope.pb`` -- within
our CLI container. However, we need signatures from the requisite Admin users
before the config can be written to the ledger. The modification policy (mod_policy)
for our channel Application group is set to the default of "MAJORITY", which means that
we need a majority of existing org admins to sign it. Because we have only two orgs --
Org1 and Org2 -- and the majority of two is two, we need both of them to sign. Without
both signatures, the ordering service will reject the transaction for failing to
fulfill the policy.

First, let's sign this update proto as the Org1 Admin. Remember that the CLI container
is bootstrapped with the Org1 MSP material, so we simply need to issue the
``peer channel signconfigtx`` command:

.. code:: bash

  peer channel signconfigtx -f org3_update_in_envelope.pb

The final step is to switch the CLI container's identity to reflect the Org2 Admin
user. We do this by exporting four environment variables specific to the Org2 MSP.

.. note:: Switching between organizations to sign a config transaction (or to do anything
          else) is not reflective of a real-world Fabric operation. A single container
          would never be mounted with an entire network's crypto material. Rather, the
          config update would need to be securely passed out-of-band to an Org2
          Admin for inspection and approval.

Export the Org2 environment variables:

.. code:: bash

  # you can issue all of these commands at once

  export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org2MSP"

  export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt

  export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp

  export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org2.example.com:7051

Lastly, we will issue the ``peer channel update`` command. The Org2 Admin signature
will be attached to this call so there is no need to manually sign the protobuf a
second time:

.. note:: The upcoming update call to the ordering service will undergo a series
          of systematic signature and policy checks. As such you may find it
          useful to stream and inspect the ordering node's logs. From another shell,
          issue a ``docker logs -f orderer.example.com`` command to display them.

Send the update call:

.. code:: bash

  peer channel update -f org3_update_in_envelope.pb -c $CHANNEL_NAME -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA

You should see a message digest indication similar to the following if your
update has been submitted successfully:

.. code:: bash

  2018-02-24 18:56:33.499 UTC [msp/identity] Sign -> DEBU 00f Sign: digest: 3207B24E40DE2FAB87A2E42BC004FEAA1E6FDCA42977CB78C64F05A88E556ABA

You will also see the submission of our configuration transaction:

.. code:: bash

  2018-02-24 18:56:33.499 UTC [channelCmd] update -> INFO 010 Successfully submitted channel update

The successful channel update call returns a new block -- block 5 -- to all of the
peers on the channel. If you remember, blocks 0-2 are the initial channel
configurations while blocks 3 and 4 are the instantiation and invocation of
the ``mycc`` chaincode. As such, block 5 serves as the most recent channel
configuration with Org3 now defined on the channel.

Inspect the logs for ``peer0.org1.example.com``:

.. code:: bash

      docker logs -f peer0.org1.example.com

Follow the demonstrated process to fetch and decode the new config block if you wish to inspect
its contents.

Configuring Leader Election

.. note:: This section is included as a general reference for understanding
          the leader election settings when adding organizations to a network
          after the initial channel configuration has completed. This sample
          defaults to dynamic leader election, which is set for all peers in the
          network in `peer-base.yaml`.

Newly joining peers are bootstrapped with the genesis block, which does not
contain information about the organization that is being added in the channel
configuration update. Therefore new peers are not able to utilize gossip as
they cannot verify blocks forwarded by other peers from their own organization
until they get the configuration transaction which added the organization to the
channel. Newly added peers must therefore have one of the following
configurations so that they receive blocks from the ordering service:

1. To utilize static leader mode, configure the peer to be an organization
leader:

::

    CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=false
    CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true


.. note:: This configuration must be the same for all new peers added to the
channel.

2. To utilize dynamic leader election, configure the peer to use leader
election:

::

    CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true
    CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false


.. note:: Because peers of the newly added organization won't be able to form
          membership view, this option will be similar to the static
          configuration, as each peer will start proclaiming itself to be a
          leader. However, once they get updated with the configuration
          transaction that adds the organization to the channel, there will be
          only one active leader for the organization. Therefore, it is
          recommended to leverage this option if you eventually want the
          organization's peers to utilize leader election.


Join Org3 to the Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the channel configuration has been updated to include our new
organization -- ``Org3`` -- meaning that peers attached to it can now join ``mychannel``.

First, let's launch the containers for the Org3 peers and an Org3-specific CLI.

Open a new terminal and from ``first-network`` kick off the Org3 docker compose:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose -f docker-compose-org3.yaml up -d

This new compose file has been configured to bridge across our initial network,
so the two peers and the CLI container will be able to resolve with the existing
peers and ordering node. With the three new containers now running, exec into
the Org3-specific CLI container:

.. code:: bash

  docker exec -it Org3cli bash

Just as we did with the initial CLI container, export the two key environment
variables: ``ORDERER_CA`` and ``CHANNEL_NAME``:

.. code:: bash

  export ORDERER_CA=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem && export CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel

Check to make sure the variables have been properly set:

.. code:: bash

  echo $ORDERER_CA && echo $CHANNEL_NAME

Now let's send a call to the ordering service asking for the genesis block of
``mychannel``. The ordering service is able to verify the Org3 signature
attached to this call as a result of our successful channel update. If Org3
has not been successfully appended to the channel config, the ordering
service should reject this request.

.. note:: Again, you may find it useful to stream the ordering node's logs
          to reveal the sign/verify logic and policy checks.

Use the ``peer channel fetch`` command to retrieve this block:

.. code:: bash

  peer channel fetch 0 mychannel.block -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA

Notice, that we are passing a ``0`` to indicate that we want the first block on
the channel's ledger (i.e. the genesis block). If we simply passed the
``peer channel fetch config`` command, then we would have received block 5 -- the
updated config with Org3 defined. However, we can't begin our ledger with a
downstream block -- we must start with block 0.

Issue the ``peer channel join`` command and pass in the genesis block -- ``mychannel.block``:

.. code:: bash

  peer channel join -b mychannel.block

If you want to join the second peer for Org3, export the ``TLS`` and ``ADDRESS`` variables
and reissue the ``peer channel join command``:

.. code:: bash

  export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org3.example.com/peers/peer1.org3.example.com/tls/ca.crt && export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.org3.example.com:7051

  peer channel join -b mychannel.block

Upgrade and Invoke Chaincode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final piece of the puzzle is to increment the chaincode version and update
the endorsement policy to include Org3. Since we know that an upgrade is coming,
we can forgo the futile exercise of installing version 1 of the chaincode. We
are solely concerned with the new version where Org3 will be part of the
endorsement policy, therefore we'll jump directly to version 2 of the chaincode.

From the Org3 CLI:

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 2.0 -p github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/

Modify the environment variables accordingly and reissue the command if you want to
install the chaincode on the second peer of Org3. Note that a second installation is
not mandated, as you only need to install chaincode on peers that are going to serve as
endorsers or otherwise interface with the ledger (i.e. query only). Peers will
still run the validation logic and serve as committers without a running chaincode
container.

Now jump back to the **original** CLI container and install the new version on the
Org1 and Org2 peers. We submitted the channel update call with the Org2 admin
identity, so the container is still acting on behalf of ``peer0.org2``:

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 2.0 -p github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/

Flip to the ``peer0.org1`` identity:

.. code:: bash

  export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"

  export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt

  export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp

  export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051

And install again:

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 2.0 -p github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/

Now we're ready to upgrade the chaincode. There have been no modifications to
the underlying source code, we are simply adding Org3 to the endorsement policy for
a chaincode -- ``mycc`` -- on ``mychannel``.

.. note:: Any identity satisfying the chaincode's instantiation policy can issue
          the upgrade call. By default, these identities are the channel Admins.

Send the call:

.. code:: bash

  peer chaincode upgrade -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n mycc -v 2.0 -c '{"Args":["init","a","90","b","210"]}' -P "OR ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer','Org3MSP.peer')"

You can see in the above command that we are specifying our new version by means
of the ``v`` flag. You can also see that the endorsement policy has been modified to
``-P "OR ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer','Org3MSP.peer')"``, reflecting the
addition of Org3 to the policy. The final area of interest is our constructor
request (specified with the ``c`` flag).

As with an instantiate call, a chaincode upgrade requires usage of the ``init``
method. **If** your chaincode requires arguments be passed to the ``init`` method,
then you will need to do so here.

The upgrade call adds a new block -- block 6 -- to the channel's ledger and allows
for the Org3 peers to execute transactions during the endorsement phase. Hop
back to the Org3 CLI container and issue a query for the value of ``a``. This will
take a bit of time because a chaincode image needs to be built for the targeted peer,
and the container needs to start:

.. code:: bash

    peer chaincode query -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'

We should see a response of ``Query Result: 90``.

Now issue an invocation to move ``10`` from ``a`` to ``b``:

.. code:: bash

    peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050  --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n mycc -c '{"Args":["invoke","a","b","10"]}'

Query one final time:

.. code:: bash

    peer chaincode query -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'

We should see a response of ``Query Result: 80``, accurately reflecting the
update of this chaincode's world state.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The channel configuration update process is indeed quite involved, but there is a
logical method to the various steps. The endgame is to form a delta transaction object
represented in protobuf binary format and then acquire the requisite number of admin
signatures such that the channel configuration update transaction fulfills the channel's
modification policy.

The ``configtxlator`` and ``jq`` tools, along with the ever-growing ``peer channel``
commands, provide us with the functionality to accomplish this task.
